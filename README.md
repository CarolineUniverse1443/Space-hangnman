# Space-hangman

  By definition Hangman is a game for two or more people, in which one of them (the leader) puzzles the word and draws on the sheet a series of squares, the number of which is equal to the length of the word. Also a gallows with a loop is drawn. For each wrong answer, the presenter adds a part of the human body to the gallows. The task of other players is to guess this word and not to let the man hang himself. The following game is different in that it is the computer to guess the password, not the word.
  To find out the password, the player should guess all symbols in it by pressing the keys on the game keyboard. If the pressed symbol is in the password, it will be displayed on the screen and the key will turn green. Otherwise the pressed key becomes red and the number of errors increases. With each error the UFO will approach to the Earth. When the player reaches 6 errors, the game will end and the Earth will be destroyed UFO.
  The player can also choose the level of difficulty in the settings. There are three: easy, middle and hard mode.
